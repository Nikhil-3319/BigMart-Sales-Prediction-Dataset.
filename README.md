# BigMart Sales Prediction — A Regression Problem

Predicting `Item_Outlet_Sales` for products across BigMart outlets using exploratory
data analysis, feature engineering, and a comparison of multiple regression algorithms.

##  Problem Statement

The data scientists at BigMart have collected sales data for 1559 products across
10 stores in different cities. The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates
the sales of each product at a particular store — helping BigMart understand the
properties of products and stores that play a key role in increasing sales.

##  Dataset

The dataset (`Train.csv` / `Test.csv`) contains 8523 training records with 12 columns:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Item_Identifier | Unique product ID |
| Item_Weight | Weight of the product |
| Item_Fat_Content | Whether the product is low fat or regular |
| Item_Visibility | % of total display area allocated to the product |
| Item_Type | Category the product belongs to |
| Item_MRP | Maximum Retail Price |
| Outlet_Identifier | Unique store ID |
| Outlet_Establishment_Year | Year the outlet was established |
| Outlet_Size | Size of the store (Small/Medium/High) |
| Outlet_Location_Type | Type of city the outlet is in |
| Outlet_Type | Grocery store or supermarket type |
| **Item_Outlet_Sales** | **Target variable** — sales of the product in that store |

##  Approach

1. **EDA** — inspected shape, dtypes, missing values, summary statistics, and
   correlation heatmap; visualized the (right-skewed) target distribution.
2. **Missing Value Treatment** — imputed `Item_Weight` with the mean and
   `Outlet_Size` with the mode.
3. **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**
   - Dropped ID columns with no predictive value (`Item_Identifier`, `Outlet_Identifier`)
   - Standardized inconsistent `Item_Fat_Content` labels (`LF`, `low fat` → `Low Fat`, etc.)
   - Encoded `Outlet_Size` and `Outlet_Location_Type` as ordinal integers
   - Engineered `Outlet_Age` from `Outlet_Establishment_Year`
   - Squared `Item_MRP` and `Item_Visibility` to strengthen their linear relationship with sales
   - One-hot encoded remaining categorical columns
4. **Outlier Treatment** — tested percentile-based clipping on `Item_Visibility`, but
   it reduced model performance, so it was left out of the final pipeline.
5. **Modeling** — trained and benchmarked 8 regression algorithms on an 80/20 split:
   - Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet
   - Extra Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - K-Neighbors Regressor, XGBoost Regressor

##  Results

| Model | R² | RMSE | MAE |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Gradient Boosting Regressor** | **~0.60** | **~1038.2** | **~738.2** |
| Linear Regression | ~0.56 | — | — |
| Ridge Regression | ~0.56 | — | — |

Gradient Boosting Regressor gave the best results, followed closely by Linear and
Ridge Regression.

##  How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bigmart-sales-prediction.git
cd bigmart-sales-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download `Train.csv` and `Test.csv` from Kaggle into `data/`, then open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/bigmart-sales-data-sales-regression.ipynb
```

## Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / Optuna) for the top-performing models
- Try stacking/ensembling Gradient Boosting with XGBoost
- Log-transform the target to handle right-skew before modeling
- Cross-validation instead of a single train/test split for more robust scores
